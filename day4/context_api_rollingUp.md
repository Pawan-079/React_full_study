### Context API and Rolling Up the State in React

React's **Context API** is a powerful tool for managing and sharing state across a component tree without the need to pass props down manually at every level. It's particularly useful for managing "global" state, such as themes, authentication, or user preferences, in applications.

"Rolling up the state" refers to consolidating and centralizing state management so that it can be easily accessed and updated from any part of the application, avoiding issues like prop drilling.

### **What is the Context API?**

The Context API allows you to create a contextâ€”a way to share data across multiple components without explicitly passing it down through props.

#### Key Components of the Context API:
1. **`React.createContext()`**:
   - Creates a new context object.
   - Provides two components: 
     - `<Provider>`: Makes the context available to its child components.
     - `<Consumer>`: Allows components to access the context value.

2. **`useContext()`**:
   - A hook introduced in React 16.8.
   - Provides an easy way to access the context value without using `<Consumer>`.

---

### **Steps to Use Context API**

#### Step 1: Create the Context

Create a context object using `React.createContext`.

```jsx
import React, { createContext } from "react";

const AppContext = createContext();

export default AppContext;
```

---

#### Step 2: Create a Provider Component

The provider component holds the state and provides it to the rest of the app.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import AppContext from "./AppContext";

const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "John Doe", isLoggedIn: true });

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default AppProvider;
```

- **`value`**: The `value` prop in `<Provider>` allows you to pass any data, including state and functions, to the consuming components.
- **`children`**: Wrap your application or specific parts of it with the `<Provider>` component to make the context available.

---

#### Step 3: Use Context in Child Components

You can consume the context using the `useContext` hook.

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import AppContext from "./AppContext";

const UserProfile = () => {
  const { user, setUser } = useContext(AppContext);

  const handleLogout = () => {
    setUser({ name: "", isLoggedIn: false });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome, {user.name}</h2>
      {user.isLoggedIn && <button onClick={handleLogout}>Logout</button>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
```

---

#### Step 4: Wrap the App with the Provider

Finally, wrap your app (or part of it) with the `AppProvider` to make the context available to its children.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import AppProvider from "./AppProvider";
import UserProfile from "./UserProfile";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AppProvider>
      <UserProfile />
    </AppProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

---

### **Advantages of Context API**
1. **Avoid Prop Drilling**:
   - Context API eliminates the need to pass props down through multiple levels of components, making the code cleaner and more manageable.

2. **Global State Management**:
   - Ideal for managing global states like authentication, themes, and user preferences.

3. **Lightweight Alternative to Redux**:
   - For smaller apps, Context API can replace more complex state management libraries like Redux.

---

### **Rolling Up the State**

"Rolling up the state" in React refers to the process of centralizing the application's state at a higher level in the component tree. The Context API is often used to achieve this by lifting the state to a central provider and distributing it down as needed.

#### Why Roll Up the State?
- Simplifies state management by consolidating related states into a single source of truth.
- Reduces redundancy and complexity when managing state in multiple components.
- Improves scalability and maintainability of the codebase.

---

### **Example: Rolling Up State with Context**

Imagine you have a shopping cart application. Instead of managing the cart state in multiple components, you can roll it up into a central context.

#### Centralized State (Cart Context)

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState } from "react";

const CartContext = createContext();

const CartProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);

  const addToCart = (item) => setCart([...cart, item]);
  const removeFromCart = (itemId) => setCart(cart.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId));

  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={{ cart, addToCart, removeFromCart }}>
      {children}
    </CartContext.Provider>
  );
};

export { CartContext, CartProvider };
```

#### Consuming the Cart Context

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "./CartContext";

const ProductList = () => {
  const { cart, addToCart } = useContext(CartContext);

  const products = [
    { id: 1, name: "Product A" },
    { id: 2, name: "Product B" },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Products</h2>
      <ul>
        {products.map((product) => (
          <li key={product.id}>
            {product.name}
            <button onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>Add to Cart</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h3>Cart Items:</h3>
      <ul>
        {cart.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductList;
```

#### Wrapping the Application

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { CartProvider } from "./CartContext";
import ProductList from "./ProductList";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CartProvider>
      <ProductList />
    </CartProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### **Conclusion**

The **Context API** combined with "rolling up the state" is a powerful pattern in React for managing global state. It simplifies passing data between components, avoids prop drilling, and creates a clean, scalable architecture. Whether for user authentication, theming, or managing a shopping cart, the Context API provides a flexible and lightweight solution.
