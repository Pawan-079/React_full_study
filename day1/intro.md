## 1. Introduction to React

### What is React?
React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by **Facebook**. It simplifies the process of creating dynamic and interactive web applications by providing a component-based architecture and efficient rendering through a virtual DOM.

#### Example:
Here is a simple React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome() {
    return <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

### Key Features of React
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Applications are built using reusable components, making the code easier to maintain and scale.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering, updating only the parts of the DOM that need changes.
- **Declarative UI**: Developers describe how the UI should look, and React handles updating the DOM to match the application state.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, simplifying state management and making it easier to debug.
- **React Hooks**: Hooks allow functional components to manage state and lifecycle methods without needing class components.

#### Example of React's Declarative UI:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Prerequisites
Before diving into React, it is essential to have a foundational understanding of:

1. **HTML**
    - Understanding of semantic elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
    - Basics of attributes, forms, and events.

2. **CSS**
    - Familiarity with selectors, classes, and responsive design concepts (e.g., Flexbox, Grid).
    - Styling elements and managing layouts.

3. **JavaScript (ES6)**
    - Understanding key features like:
        - Arrow functions
        - Destructuring
        - Template literals
        - Promises and async/await

    #### Example:
    ```javascript
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    const name = "React";
    console.log(`Welcome to ${name}`);
    ```

4. **Command Line Basics**
    - Navigate between directories and execute commands using the terminal.

5. **Version Control with Git**
    - Basic understanding of Git commands like `git clone`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

If you are not familiar with these topics, consider brushing up on them before starting React to ensure a smoother learning experience.

### Notes:
- Focus on writing small, functional components and gradually work on building complex apps.
- Practice regularly by working on hands-on projects.
